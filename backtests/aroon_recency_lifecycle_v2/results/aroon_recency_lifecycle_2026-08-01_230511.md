# Trial 425–431 — Aroon Extreme-Recency Lifecycle

Best-available frozen OOS accessed: **NO**

## Backtest Score: 20/100 — Reject

Discovery-only reduced-denominator score; it cannot qualify the strategy.

| Component | Score | Available max |
|---|---:|---:|
| A. Statistical validity | 7 | 30 |
| B. Risk-adjusted performance | 7 | 25 |
| C. Robustness (bootstrap only) | 0 | 8 |
| D. Trade quality / consistency | 6 | 20 |
| **Measured total** | **20** | **83** |
| **Normalized raw score** | **24** | **100** |
| Caps applied | Unresolved survivorship → 20; no formal OOS / WFA → 55 | |
| **Final score** | **20** | **100** |

WFA efficiency (10 points) and parameter sensitivity (7 points) were unavailable because the train gate failed. Their weight was redistributed under the reduced-denominator rule rather than silently scored as zero. The lower unresolved-survivorship cap then applies to the normalized score.

Train states 4165; signals 101; trades 75; CAGR 0.08%; Sharpe 0.040; PF 1.022; MDD -5.83%; trim-5 expectancy -1.10%.
